The Molecular Playground software has 4 components (so far):

MPControlHub: the primary application that controls everything else

MPJmolApp: Jmol wrapped in some extra code so that it can interface with the hub

MPKinectDriver: app to detect motion from a Kinect camera and send it to the hub

MPRemote: an iOS-based remote control app
